# Carlang

A simple and effective programming language which transpiles to JavaScript.

## Language Features

### Data Types

1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean

### Variable Assignment

To assign a variable in Carlang we use the `set` keyword. The `set` keyword is followed by the identifier and then the value. For instance, `set x 2` will assign variable x with a value of 2. The data type inferred will be number in this case.
